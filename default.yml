      Hi $|$,
      Thank you for your availability. This will be a 2-hour pair programming session with <_______>. To prepare for this, please
      install Tuple (https://tuple.app), our preferred pair programming tool. This will allow us to remotely pair. You will not need anything 
      else set up on your machine. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions.

      Thanks,
      Zoe
